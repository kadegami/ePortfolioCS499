# Karina Washington – Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my ePortfolio for SNHU’s CS-499 Capstone Project.  
Here, I showcase three key artifacts that demonstrate my skills across major computer science domains.

## 🟣 Software Design & Engineering
**CS-330: 3D Scene Project (OpenGL)**
- Developed an interactive 3D desk environment using C++ and OpenGL.
- Enhanced structure through modular scene and shader management.

## 🟢 Algorithms & Data Structures
**CS-350: GPIO Morse Code Embedded System**
- Designed a state machine to control LEDs using interrupts and timers.
- Demonstrates algorithm design and embedded C programming.
